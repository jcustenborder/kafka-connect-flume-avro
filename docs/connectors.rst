Flume Connector
===============

The Flume connector provides a method to receive data from `Apache Flume <https://flume.apache.org/>`_ using the
`Flume Avro Source <https://flume.apache.org/FlumeUserGuide.html#avro-source>`_ to receive the events as they are transmitted
from Flume to a Kafka Connect Worker.
